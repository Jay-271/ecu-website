      Hello once more, my name is Jason Avila-Soria! <br />
      I am a senior student here at ECU. I come from a small rural town next
      to Bunn, NC. <br />
      My favorite game is currently Mobile Legends, and I got into Computer
      Science and coding <br />
      when I was young and was excited about making stuff move with the block
      "for" loops (I forgot what it was called). <br />
      But this is why I chose to major in Computer Science.
      I am excited to learn the concepts here and hopefully I can <br /> take what I
      learn into React which is what I'm learning on my own time. <br />
      <a style="font-size: 10px"> ngl half the time I write CSS I'm just like "Welp if it works it works" xD</a>
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0">Thank you for stopping by~</h2>
